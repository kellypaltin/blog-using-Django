# blog-using-Django

Created a simple functioning blog, to upload, delete, edit and list all posts via forms, deployed online to follow the code process for this blog I had help from a workshop from django girls (credits to: https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/es/)

To run it as admin, first enter virtual environment in .../djangogirls, then activate with: myvenv\Scripts\activate

Then iniciate server: (myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py runserver

Where it gives us the homepage: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Other important urls included are: http://127.0.0.1:8000/post/new/ , http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
